There are two main features of this app that I created which can be accessed through the zip file that I have created. 

The app is a funny thing that I have developed that asks a common New York slang phrase ("Can I get a Yessir?") to the user

1. The user can click the "Yessir" button and it would prompt the app to play the "yessir" sound that I have downloaded and shows a disappearing message
2. The user can on other hand click the "No Sir" button and it would prompt the app to play the "nosir" sound that I have downloaded and also shows
the disappearing message
